# 5.4 Integration Architecture

This section describes the integration architecture of the Inventory Management Application, detailing how the system interfaces with external systems, services, and APIs.

## Integration Approach

The Inventory Management Application follows these integration principles:

1. **API-First Design**: All integrations are built on well-defined APIs
2. **Loose Coupling**: Minimal dependencies between integrated systems
3. **Security by Design**: Secure authentication and authorization for all integrations
4. **Resilience**: Graceful handling of integration failures
5. **Standardization**: Consistent patterns for different types of integrations
6. **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new integrations

## Integration Patterns

```

### REST API Integration

The application provides and consumes RESTful APIs for synchronous integrations:

1. **API Gateway**: Appwrite Functions acts as an API gateway for external systems
2. **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 or API key authentication for all API endpoints
3. **Data Formats**: JSON for request and response bodies
4. **Versioning**: API versioning (v1, v2) to maintain backward compatibility
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against excessive API usage
6. **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all exposed endpoints

### Webhook Integration

The system supports webhook-based event-driven integrations:

1. **Event Publishing**: Outbound webhooks for system events
2. **Event Consumption**: Inbound webhook endpoints for external events
3. **Retry Mechanism**: Automatic retries for failed webhook deliveries
4. **Signature Verification**: Security verification of webhook sources
5. **Webhook Management**: Interface for managing webhook subscriptions and endpoints

### File-Based Integration

For batch processing and legacy system integration:

1. **Import/Export**: Standardized file formats (CSV, Excel, XML)
2. **Secure Transfer**: Secure file transfer protocols
3. **Scheduled Exchange**: Automated scheduled file exchanges
4. **Transformation**: Data mapping and transformation capabilities
5. **Validation**: Comprehensive validation of imported data

### Email Integration

Email-based integrations for notifications and reporting:

1. **Notification Delivery**: Email notifications for system events
2. **Report Distribution**: Scheduled report distribution via email
3. **Email Processing**: Processing incoming emails for specific functions
4. **Templating**: Customizable email templates
