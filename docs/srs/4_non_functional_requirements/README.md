# 4. Non-Functional Requirements

This section specifies all the non-functional requirements of the Inventory Management Application. These requirements specify criteria that can be used to judge the operation of the system, rather than specific behaviors or functions.

## Sections

- [4.1 Performance](./4.1_performance.md)
- [4.2 Security](./4.2_security.md)
- [4.3 Reliability](./4.3_reliability.md)
- [4.4 Usability](./4.4_usability.md)
- [4.5 Compatibility](./4.5_compatibility.md)

These requirements are critical to ensuring the system meets the quality expectations of users and stakeholders. Each requirement is specified with measurable criteria where possible to facilitate validation and verification.
