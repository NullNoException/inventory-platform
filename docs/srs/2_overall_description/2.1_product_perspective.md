# 2.1 Product Perspective

The Inventory Management Application is designed as a standalone system that can operate independently while offering integration capabilities with other systems as needed. This section describes how the application relates to other products and systems.

## System Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture with:

1. **Flutter Frontend (Client)**

   - Provides a cross-platform user interface for iOS, Android, and web
   - Handles local state management and UI rendering
   - Implements offline capabilities with local data storage

2. **Appwrite Backend (Server)**
   - Manages authentication and authorization
   - Handles data storage and retrieval
   - Processes business logic and implements API endpoints
   - Manages real-time data synchronization

   - REST API for data exchange

2. **Data Formats**
   - JSON for data interchange
   - Base64 for binary data encoding

## Memory and Storage Constraints

- Minimum 100MB of storage space on mobile devices
- Offline storage capacity based on device limitations
- Database storage scales according to business needs

## Operations

The application will support the following operational modes:

1. **Online Mode** - Full functionality with real-time updates
2. **Offline Mode** - Limited functionality with local data storage
3. **Synchronization Mode** - Reconciling local data with server when connectivity is restored
