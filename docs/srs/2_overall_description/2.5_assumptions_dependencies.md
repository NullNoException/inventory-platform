# 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

This section outlines the assumptions that have been made during the requirements specification process and the dependencies that affect the development of the Inventory Management Application.

## Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions

1. **User Devices and Environment**

   - Users have access to compatible devices (smartphones, tablets, or computers)
   - Users have intermittent internet connectivity, at minimum
   - Device cameras are available for barcode scanning functionality
   - Users' devices have sufficient storage for offline data caching

2. **Appwrite Backend**

   - Appwrite server is properly configured and maintained
   - Appwrite provides all necessary services for the application (Authentication, Database, Storage, Functions)
   - Appwrite can handle the expected data volume and user concurrency
   - Appwrite will continue to be supported throughout the application lifecycle

3. **Flutter Framework**
   - Flutter provides stable cross-platform compatibility for iOS, Android, and web
   - Flutter packages required by the application are maintained and compatible
   - Flutter's performance is sufficient for the application's requirements

### Business Assumptions

1. **User Capabilities**

   - Users have basic understanding of inventory management concepts
   - Users can follow guided workflows with minimal training
   - Administrative users have technical knowledge to configure the system

2. **Operational Assumptions**
   - The organization has established inventory management processes
   - The organization can provide necessary product data for initial setup
   - The organization has defined roles and responsibilities for system users
